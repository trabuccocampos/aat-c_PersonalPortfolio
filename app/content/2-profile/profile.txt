Aboutdo: 

I am a visual designer who produces works both in print and on the web.

With a broad approach, I take my ideas from beginning to end, paying attention to legibility, hierarchy, layouts and interaction.

I am intrigued by the evolution of new digital landscapes — how they’re informed by the large print tradition, and vice versa, how print environments are affected by the digital progression.

Aboutam: 

Born in Bogotá, Colombia, I was raised near Lucca, Italy. When I was 16 my family and I moved to the United States. I lived in Miami and later moved to NYC to study Philosophy at New York University.

In 2013, I moved to Milan to pursue a double Master’s in Visual and Web design from the Scuola Politecnica di Design (SPD). After graduating, I worked for Italy’s largest financial newspaper, *Il Sole 24 Ore*. Recently, I moved back to what has become my home, NYC, to pursue a career in design.
